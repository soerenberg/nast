# nast
## Stan parser written in Haskell.
This is a parser for the [probabilistic programming Stan](https://mc-stan.org)
I wrote as  a small learning project.

If I find the time in the future I might try to form this into a simple code
formatter or a transpiler to a different language / framework.

I also wrote a [Stan parser in Python](https://github.com/soerenberg/pynast).
